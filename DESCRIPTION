Description: A toolkit for processing single-cell TCR-sequencing data into
    clonotype groups with varying levels of stringency. VDJigsaw addresses
    the challenge of missing chain data by leveraging dataset-wide evidence
    to puzzle together T-cell receptor alpha and beta chains into coherent
    clonotype definitions, reducing fragmented clonotypes caused by
    sequencing dropout.
