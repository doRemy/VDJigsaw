\title{Summarize clonotype changes across stringency levels}
\usage{
clonotype_summary(TCR_data, mapping_levels = .mapping.levels)
}
\arguments{
\item{TCR_data}{A data frame with clone ID columns for each stringency
level (as output by \code{\link{assign_clonotype}}).}

\item{mapping_levels}{Character vector of stringency level names in order
from most to least strict.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the number of clonotypes and whether
merging occurred at each stringency level transition.
}
\description{
Tracks how clonotype assignments change as the stringency level is relaxed,
identifying which clonotypes are merged at each successive level.
