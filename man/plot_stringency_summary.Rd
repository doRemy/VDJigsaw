plot_stringency_summary(
  TCR_data,
  mapping_levels = .mapping.levels,
  sample_filter = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{TCR_data}{A data frame with clone ID columns for each stringency
level (as output by \code{\link{assign_clonotype}}).}

\item{mapping_levels}{Character vector of stringency level names in order
from most to least strict.}

\item{sample_filter}{Optional sample name to filter to. If \code{NULL},
all samples are included. Ignored when \code{per_sample = TRUE}.}

\item{per_sample}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, create a separate plot for
each unique sample.}

\item{combined}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{per_sample = TRUE},
combine all per-sample plots into a single figure using
\code{patchwork}. If \code{FALSE}, return a named list of plots.}

\item{title}{Plot title.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object, or a named list of \code{ggplot} objects
when \code{per_sample = TRUE} and \code{combined = FALSE}.
}
\description{
Creates a two-panel bar chart showing how clonotype counts and cell
assignments change across stringency levels. The top panel shows the
number of unique clonotypes at each level (decreasing as clones merge).
The bottom panel shows the number of cells assigned vs unassigned at
each level. Counts are displayed on top of each bar.
